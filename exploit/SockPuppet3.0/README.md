# SockPuppet 3

This is a kernel exploit targeting iOS 12.0-12.2 and 12.4. It exploits a dangling kernel pointer to craft a fake task port
corresponding to the kernel task and gets a send right to it.

This code is not readily compilable â€” some common sense is a prerequisite. If you do get it going though, it is extremely
reliable on any device with more than a gigabyte of RAM. Interested readers may want to investigate how reallocations
can be prevented -- this might improve reliability even more.
